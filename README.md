Without the operating system (OS), the software wouldnâ€™t function.<br>
History of Linux<br>
In 1991, a finish student named Linus Torvalds started working on a personal project of creating his own system kernel which later became an entire operating system with the kernel at the center. You can read more about it here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Linux.<br>
